Sudoku Validator
The solution for the Sudoku Validator has been implemented in JAVA. On the main method a matrix of 9x9 has been
initialized which represents the Sudoku grid.
To test my soulution for Sudoku Validator you can just copy the code from github and paste it on any code editor or
IDE that supports and executes JAVA code.
On the comment section of the code there are some matrix samples that you have to copy and paste on the matrix on the
main method to test them.
